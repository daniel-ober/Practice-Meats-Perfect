Contest Reps and necessary support staff are allowed in judging area during the judging
process. No other activities are permitted in the judging area, during judging process.
4. Each judge will first score all the samples for appearance of the meat. The turn-in containers
will then be passed around the table and each judge will place a sample from each of the
containers in the appropriate box on the judging plate. Judges shall not lick their fingers while
taking samples; paper towels, non-scented wipes or damp wash cloths are preferred. The judge

6. A score of one (1) is a penalty or disqualification and requires approval by a Contest Rep.
 Grounds for penalties: --All judges will give a one (1) in Appearance for:
a. unapproved garnish
b. pooled sauce
c. less than 6 samples of meat.- All judges not receiving a sample will give a one (1) in all
criteria.

The low score will be thrown out. Results will be tallied. If there is a tie in one of the
categories, it will be broken by the computer, as follows: The scores will be compared
(counting all five judges) for the highest cumulative scores in taste, then tenderness, then
appearance. If still tied, then the low score, which was thrown out, will be compared and the
higher of the low scores will break the tie. If still tied, then a computer generated coin toss will
be used.
