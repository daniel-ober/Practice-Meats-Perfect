          As a judge, you will first score your sample for appearance of the
          meat. If multiple judges are scoring, the turn-in container will be
          passed around carefully for each judge to take a sample from the
          container and place on their plate (or in the appropriate box, if
          using a scoring plate). Judges shall not lick their fingers while
          taking samples; paper towels, non-scented wipes or damp wash cloths
          are preferred. The judge will then score each entry for taste and
          tenderness, before moving on to the a new judging slip.
