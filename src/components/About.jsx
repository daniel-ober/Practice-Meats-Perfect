        Hot Chicken Helper gives hot chicken enthusiasts the ability to share their feedback via a
        judging 'slip'. What makes Hot Chicken Helper so unique is it's robust scoring
        system. Our carefully curated score system factors in the three major
        scoring categories used in today's most competitive hot chicken competition: Appearance,
        Taste, and Tenderness. Navigate to our Home screen to view recently
        judged hot chicken, or click on the 'New Judging Slip' page to submit your own
        scoring slip and image link!
