        BBQ Wars gives BBQ enthusiasts the ability to share their feedback via a
        judging 'slip'. What makes BBQ Wars so unique is it's robust scoring
        system. Our carefully curated score system factors in the three major
        scoring categories used in today's most competitive BBQ: Appearance,
        Taste, and Tenderness. Navigate to our Home screen to view recently
        judged BBQ, or click on the 'New Judging Slip' page to submit your own
        scoring slip and image link!
